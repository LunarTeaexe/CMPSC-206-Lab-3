        <h1> Lab 3 </h1>
        <p> One of my current interest is in various video games. 
        One of the top ones being "Final Fantasy XIV".</p>
        
        <p>The main appeal of the game is the open world and MMO
        aspects. You can play various classes ranging from magical to physical.</p>

        <p> A personal favorite is the Paladin class. Its a tank role, meaning you're
        able to take the most damage without being knocked down. This role is mostly 
        front and center when dealing with enemies on the battle field.</p>

        <p>Another part of the game I enjoy is the music. Below is an example of 
        the music from the area called "Gridania" </p>
        
        <img src="/Images/gridania%20night.jpg" alt="FFXIV Gridania at night" style="width:210px;height:128px;">
        <audio controls>
        <source src="/Audios/FFXIV%20OST%20Gridania%20Night%20Time%20Theme%20(%20Dance%20of%20the%20Fireflies%20).mp3" type="audio/mp3">
        </audio>
        
        <p> Finally, something I do as a pass time with friends is raid, where 
        you take on difficult bosses together as a team of 8 players. The following
        is a clip from Twitch user "mickysux325".</p>
